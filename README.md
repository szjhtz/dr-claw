</details>


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or higher (**v22 LTS recommended**, see `.nvmrc`)
- At least one of the following CLI tools installed and configured:
  - [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
  <!-- - [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) -->
  <!-- - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) -->

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenLAIR/VibeLab.git
cd VibeLab
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferred settings (port, etc.)
```

4. **Check runtime network lock (important for web search):**
```bash
echo "${CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED:-0}"
```

If the output is `1`, network requests can remain blocked even if Settings permissions are opened.
Remove or override this variable in your deployment/startup layer (shell profile, systemd, Docker, PM2), then restart VibeLab.

5. **Start the application:**
```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev
```

6. **Open your browser** at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port you configured in `.env`)

## Research Lab — Quick Example

The core feature of VibeLab is the **Research Lab**.

### Step 0 — Configure Any One Agent in Settings First

Before generating a pipeline, open **Settings** (gear icon) and configure at least one agent:

- **Claude Code**: complete CLI login and verify the tool is available. If you need web search, allow `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` in Permissions.
<!-- - **Cursor CLI**: complete CLI login and verify the tool is available. If you need web search, allow network-capable shell commands (for example `Shell(curl)`, `Shell(wget)`, `Shell(python)`). -->
<!-- - **Codex**: complete CLI login and choose a suitable permission mode. -->

You only need **one** agent configured to continue. For webpage search, you can use Claude as long as network-related permissions are enabled.
<!-- For webpage search, you can use Claude, Cursor, or Codex as long as network-related permissions are enabled for the selected agent. -->

### Step 1 — Open Chat and Describe Your Research Idea

VibeLab opens **Chat** by default. If no research pipeline exists, an onboarding banner guides you to get started. Click **Use in Chat** to inject a template prompt, or simply describe your research idea in your own words.

### Step 2 — Agent Generates Your Pipeline

The agent runs the `inno-pipeline-planner` skill, asking you a few rounds of questions to understand your topic, scope, and goals. Once enough context is gathered, it generates `.pipeline/docs/research_brief.json` and `.pipeline/tasks/tasks.json` automatically.

### Step 3 — Review Tasks and Execute

Switch to **Research Lab** to review the generated task list and research brief. Click **Go to Chat** or **Use in Chat** on any task to send it to the agent for execution.

For full step-by-step operations, see **Usage Guide** below.

## Usage Guide

After starting VibeLab, open your browser and follow the steps below.

### Step 1 — Create or Open a Project

When you first open VibeLab you will see the **Projects** sidebar. You have two options:

- **Open an existing project** — VibeLab auto-discovers projects from Claude Code sessions. Click any listed project to open it.
<!-- VibeLab also supports Cursor and Codex sessions. -->
- **Create a new project** — Click the **"+"** button, choose a directory on your machine, and VibeLab will set up the workspace: `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.cursor/` (with `skills/` symlinked from the app), preset dirs (`Survey/references`, `Survey/reports`, `Ideation/ideas`, `Ideation/references`, `Experiment/code_references`, `Experiment/datasets`, `Experiment/core_code`, `Experiment/analysis`, `Publication/paper`, `Publication/homepage`, `Publication/slide`), and **instance.json** at the project root with absolute paths for those directories.

> **Default project storage path:** New projects are stored under `~/vibelab` by default. You can change this in **Settings → Appearance → Default Project Path**, or set the `WORKSPACES_ROOT` environment variable. The setting is persisted in `~/.claude/project-config.json`.

### Step 2 — Generate Your Research Pipeline via Chat

After creating or opening a project, VibeLab opens **Chat** by default. If no research pipeline exists yet, an onboarding banner appears with a **Use in Chat** button that injects a starter prompt.

Describe your research idea — even a rough one is fine. The agent uses the `inno-pipeline-planner` skill to ask clarifying questions and then generates:
- `.pipeline/docs/research_brief.json` (your structured research brief)
- `.pipeline/tasks/tasks.json` (the task pipeline)

### Step 3 — Review in Research Lab and Execute Tasks

Switch to **Research Lab** to review the generated tasks, progress metrics, and artifacts. Then execute tasks:
1. Choose a CLI backend from the **CLI selector** (Claude Code).
<!-- Also supports Cursor CLI / Codex. -->
2. In **Research Lab**, click **Go to Chat** or **Use in Chat** on a pending task.
3. The agent executes the task and writes results back to the project.

### Step 4 — Enable Network Access for Web Search (Claude)
<!-- Also applies to Cursor / Codex -->

If the agent cannot search webpages, your current permission settings are likely too restrictive. If web search still fails after you open permissions, ensure you have checked the **runtime network lock** in **Quick Start** (step 4) — if `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED` is `1`, Settings alone cannot fix it.

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar).
2. Go to **Permissions**, then choose your current agent:
- **Claude Code**:
  - Enable `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` in **Allowed Tools**.
  - Ensure they are not present in **Blocked Tools**.
  - Optionally enable **Skip permission prompts** if you want fewer confirmations.
<!-- - **Cursor CLI**:
  - Add required commands to **Allowed Shell Commands** (for example `Shell(curl)`, `Shell(wget)`, `Shell(python)`, `Shell(node)`).
  - Ensure they are not present in **Blocked Shell Commands**.
  - Optionally enable **Skip permission prompts** if you want fewer confirmations.
- **Codex**:
  - In **Permission Mode**, switch to **Bypass Permissions** when web access is required. -->
3. Return to **Chat**, start a new message, and retry your web-search prompt.

<!-- Codex mode differences:
- **Default / Accept Edits**: sandboxed execution; network may still be restricted by session policy.
- **Bypass Permissions**: `sandboxMode=danger-full-access` with full disk and network access. -->

Security note:
- Use permissive settings only in trusted projects/environments.
- After finishing web search tasks, switch back to safer settings.

### Step 5 — Resolve "Workspace Trust" or First-Run Errors

Each agent may require a one-time trust confirmation before it can execute code in your project directory. If Chat freezes or shows a trust prompt, switch to the **Shell** tab inside VibeLab and approve the prompt there.

Steps:
1. Switch to the **Shell** tab in VibeLab.
2. Approve the trust/auth prompt shown in Shell.
3. Return to **Chat** and resend your message.

By default, trust flow is already enabled in VibeLab, so you usually do **not** need to manually run extra trust commands.

The trust decision is persisted per directory — you only need to do this once per project.

> **Shell tab not working?** If the Shell tab shows `Error: posix_spawnp failed`, see [docs/faq.md](docs/faq.md) for the fix, then retry.

You can switch tabs at any time:

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Chat** | **Default first screen.** Describe your research idea to generate the pipeline, or execute tasks with the selected agent. Supports streaming responses, session resume, and message history. |
| **Research Lab** | Review research brief, task progress, and artifacts. Tasks and briefs are generated via Chat. |
| **Shell** | Drop directly into the CLI terminal for full command-line control. |
| **Files** | Browse the project file tree, view and edit files with syntax highlighting, create/rename/delete files. |
| **Git** | View diffs, stage changes, commit, and switch branches — all from the UI. |

#### Research Skills

VibeLab now uses the generated **Pipeline Task List** as the execution flow.
The project includes **100+ skills** under `skills/` to support research tasks (idea exploration, code survey, experiment development/analysis, writing, review, and delivery).
These skills are discovered by the agent and can be applied as task-level assistance throughout the workflow.
