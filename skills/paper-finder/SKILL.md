# Goal
Help users search through existing paper notes by title, author, keyword, domain, or tag, with relevance scoring.

# Workflow

## Step 1: Parse Query
Determine search type: title, author, keyword, domain, or tag search. Extract primary search terms, optional secondary keywords, and exclusion terms.

## Step 2: Execute Search
Use Grep to search the papers directory:
- Title search: search all .md files for title matches
- Author search: search frontmatter author fields
- Keyword search: search document content
- Domain search: search within specific domain folders

## Step 3: Score Results
- Title match: +10 points
- Author match: +8 points
- Content match: +5 points
- Domain match: +5 points
- Tag match: +3 points

## Step 4: Display Results
Group by research domain, show paper title (wikilink), relevance score, authors, date, and match location.

# Usage
```
/paper-finder "keyword"
/paper-finder "author name"
/paper-finder "domain" "keyword"
```
